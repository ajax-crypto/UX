### What is this repository for? ###

* UX Framework is an attempt at creating a platform independent C++11 GUI library for applications.
* Currently in heavy development.

### How do I get set up? ###

* In order to compile the code, you need [SFML 2.1 source](http://sfml-dev.org/download/sfml/2.1/) and compile with any C++11 compliant compiler on your platform.
* You can either create dynamic libraries or static ones depending on your choice.
* Compile this repository and then link with SFML libraries to build the sample application.
